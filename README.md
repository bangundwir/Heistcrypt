# HadesCrypt üî±

**Lock your secrets, rule your data.**

HadesCrypt is a modern, user-friendly file and folder encryption application built with Go and Fyne GUI framework. It provides military-grade encryption with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

## Features

### Core Features
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Simply drag files or folders to encrypt/decrypt them
- **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: Military-grade encryption with authenticated encryption
- **Argon2id Key Derivation**: State-of-the-art password-based key derivation
- **Password Generator**: Built-in secure password generator with strength meter
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress reporting with ETA

### Advanced Features
- **Folder Encryption**: Recursive encryption of entire directories
- **Multiple Encryption Modes**: 
  - Normal Mode (AES-256-GCM)
  - Paranoid Mode (planned: XChaCha20 + Serpent cascade)
- **Configuration System**: Persistent settings stored at `~/.hadescrypt/config.json`
- **Operation History**: Track all encryption/decryption operations
- **Profiles**: Save and load encryption presets
- **Force Decrypt**: Attempt recovery of corrupted files

### Security Features
- **Secure Memory Handling**: Sensitive data is cleared from memory when possible
- **Cryptographically Secure RNG**: Uses `crypto/rand` for all random number generation
- **Unique Nonces**: Each encryption operation uses a unique nonce
- **Integrity Protection**: Built-in authentication prevents tampering

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or later
- Git

### Build from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bangundwir/HadesCrypt.git
cd HadesCrypt
go build -o HadesCrypt.exe
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
1. **Launch HadesCrypt**
2. **Select a file or folder**:
  - Drag and drop files/folders onto the interface, or
  - Click "Select File" or "Select Folder" button
3. **Enter a password** or click "Generate" for a secure password
4. **Choose operation**:
   - Click "üîí Encrypt" to encrypt the selected item
   - Click "üîì Decrypt" to decrypt the selected item

### Advanced Options
Click "Advanced Options ‚ñº" to access additional features:
- **Use Keyfiles**: Add keyfile-based authentication (planned)
- **Paranoid Mode**: Use multiple encryption algorithms (planned)
- **Reed-Solomon ECC**: Add error correction for archival (planned)
- **Force Decrypt**: Attempt to decrypt corrupted files
- **Split into Chunks**: Split large files into smaller pieces (planned)
- **Compress Files**: Compress before encryption (planned)
- **Deniability Mode**: Make encrypted data indistinguishable from random (planned)
- **Recursive Mode**: Enable folder encryption/decryption

## File Formats

### Encrypted Files
- **Extensions**: `.hadescrypt` (primary), `.heistcrypt` (alternate recognized)
- **Format**: Custom binary format with header containing metadata
- **Structure**:
  ```
  [4 bytes] Magic: "HAD1"
  [1 byte]  Version
  [16 bytes] Salt for Argon2id
  [8 bytes]  Nonce prefix
  [4 bytes]  Chunk size
  [8 bytes]  Original file size
  [remaining] Encrypted data chunks
  ```

### Encrypted Folders
Two modes are supported:

1. Archive Mode (default):
  - The folder is first packed into a `tar.gz` archive
  - The single archive is encrypted producing `<folder>.hadescrypt` (or `.gpg`)
  - Decryption automatically restores the full folder structure (auto-extract)
  - Useful for preserving exact structure as one file

2. Recursive Mode (enable in Advanced Options):
  - Each file inside the folder (recursively) is encrypted individually
  - Original extension + `.hadescrypt` (or `.gpg`) is created beside each file
  - Original files can optionally be deleted if the delete option is checked
  - Already encrypted files (`.hadescrypt`, `.gpg`) are skipped automatically
  - Decryption of a selected folder now automatically finds and decrypts all encrypted files inside (no need to select each one)

Choose the mode based on distribution and update workflow (per-file allows incremental updates; archive simplifies sharing).

## Multi-File & Mixed Operations

Select multiple files and folders at once (drag-and-drop or multi-select dialog). The app:
- Accepts mixed regular files and directories
- Uses Archive or Recursive strategy per the toggle for each folder
- Shows one aggregated progress bar over total plaintext bytes
- Skips items already encrypted (`.hadescrypt`, `.heistcrypt`, `.gpg`, `.pgp`)
- Supports cancel; already finished items remain

Decryption likewise supports mixed selections; directories are scanned and encrypted items inside are auto-detected and processed.

## Folder Archive Integrity Hash

Archive Mode adds a SHA-256 hash of the plaintext `tar.gz` stored in `<archive>.hadescrypt.meta`.
On decrypt:
- ‚úÖ Match ‚Üí proceeds (`üîê Hash verified OK ‚Äî extracting...`)
- ‚ùå Mismatch ‚Üí aborts extraction (`‚ùå Hash mismatch ‚Äî decryption aborted`)

## Operation Summary Dialog

After each run a summary shows: operation, counts (files, folders), total size, duration, errors or cancellation.
History still tracks each item individually.

## Smooth Throttled Progress

Progress updates are throttled by time and delta thresholds for a fluid UI while retaining responsiveness on large batches.

## Unified Status Messages

Examples:
- `üîê Encrypting‚Ä¶`
- `üîê 3/10 report.pdf`
- `‚úÖ 10 items encrypted (1.23s)`
- `‚úÖ Folder encrypted (842ms)`
- `‚úÖ Decrypted ‚Üí data.txt (512ms)`
- `‚èπÔ∏è Canceled`
- `‚ùå <error>`

## Usage Tips
- Prefer Recursive Mode for incremental changes inside large folders
- Prefer Archive Mode for distribution + single-file integrity hashing
- Verify decrypted outputs before enabling delete-after for critical data


## Configuration

Configuration is stored at `~/.hadescrypt/config.json` and includes:
- Window size and theme preferences
- Argon2id parameters (memory, iterations, parallelism)
- Operation history
- Saved profiles
- Last used settings

## Security Considerations

### Cryptographic Algorithms
- **AES-256-GCM**: Provides both confidentiality and authenticity
- **Argon2id**: Memory-hard key derivation function resistant to GPU attacks
- **Default Parameters**: Balanced for desktop security (64 MiB memory, 1 iteration, 4 threads)

### Best Practices
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Keep encrypted files and passwords in separate locations
- Regularly backup encrypted files
- Verify decryption immediately after encryption

### Limitations
- Password recovery is impossible - keep passwords safe
- File metadata (size, timestamps) may leak information
- Large files require sufficient available disk space for temporary files
