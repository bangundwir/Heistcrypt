# Fyne GUI Architecture & UX

Derived from [ide.md](mdc:ide.md)

- Framework: Fyne (cross-platform)
- Main window must include:
  - Drag & Drop zone for files/folders
  - Password input, generator, strength indicator
  - Primary actions: "Encrypt ðŸ”’" and "Decrypt ðŸ”“"
  - Status and progress bar with ETA
- Advanced panel:
  - Toggles: Use Keyfiles, Paranoid Mode, Reedâ€“Solomon ECC, Force Decrypt,
    Split Output (size MiB), Compress (ZIP/Deflate), Deniability Mode, Recursive Mode
  - Comments field (explicitly marked as not encrypted)
- History & Profiles tabs:
  - History list with entries (name, operation, size, date, result)
  - Profiles list with create/edit/delete and example presets
- UX guidelines:
  - Simple-first defaults; advanced options hidden behind expandable panel
  - Non-blocking operations; progress updates via bindings/channels
  - Validate inputs early (paths, output, password)
  - Dark theme default; optional light theme toggle
- Accessibility & polish:
  - Keyboard shortcuts for primary actions
  - Clear error dialogs with actionable guidance
  - Preserve window size/state across launches (config)
