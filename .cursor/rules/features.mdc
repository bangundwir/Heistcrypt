# Features & Advanced Modes Behavior

Derived from [ide.md](mdc:ide.md)

- Core
  - Drag & Drop file/folder handling
  - Password-based encryption via Argon2id
  - Auto integrity check (AEAD/HMAC)
  - One-click Encrypt/Decrypt
- Key & Auth
  - Secure password generator and strength meter
  - Keyfile support (multiple, ordered)
  - Save/load profiles (preset option combinations)
- Security Modes
  - Normal: AES-256-GCM
  - Paranoid: XChaCha20 + Serpent cascade + HMAC-SHA3
  - Deniability: Output indistinguishable from random stream
- File Handling
  - Recursive mode for folders (encrypt items individually)
  - Split output file with size limit (MiB)
  - Optional compression (ZIP/Deflate) before encryption
- Recovery & Reliability
  - Reedâ€“Solomon ECC for archival; configurable redundancy
  - Force Decrypt: bypass integrity check and attempt recovery (warn user)
- UX/Status
  - Status line and progress with ETA; cancellations supported
  - Clear success/failure states for operations; record in history
